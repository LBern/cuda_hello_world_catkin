# Hello World with CUDA
This repository provides a sample CUDA project structure using catkin. 

## Build

Dependencies can be installed via `wstools`. 
The package builds as a regular catkin project, i.e.:
```
catkin build cuda_hello_world_catkin
```

Optional: Tests are also available:
```
catkin run_tests cuda_hello_world_catkin
```

## Running
A script in the folder `shared` provides a simple example (`run_demo`).
